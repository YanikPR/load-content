        <p>The time value of money draws from the idea that rational investors prefer to receive money today rather than the same amount of money in the future because of money's potential to grow in value over a given period of time. For example, money deposited into a savings account earns a certain interest
            rate, and is therefore said to be compounding in value. Further illustrating the rational investor's preference, assume you have the option to choose between receiving $10,000 now versus $10,000 in two years. It's reasonable to assume most people would choose the first option. Despite the
            equal value at time of disbursement, receiving the $10,000 today has more value and utility to the beneficiary than receiving it in the future due to the opportunity costs associated with the wait. Such opportunity costs could include the potential gain on interest were that money received
            today and held in a savings account for two years. Read more: Time Value of Money (TVM)

            Basic Time Value of Money Formula Depending on the exact situation in question, the TVM formula may change slightly. For example, in the case of annuity or perpetuity payments, the generalized formula has additional or less factors. But in general, the most fundamental TVM formula takes into account
            the following variables: FV = Future value of money PV = Present value of money i = interest rate n = number of compounding periods per year t = number of years Based on these variables, the formula for TVM is: FV = PV x [ 1 + (i / n) ] (n x t) Time Value of Money Example Assume a sum of
            $10,000 is invested for one year at 10% interest. The future value of that money is: FV = $10,000 x (1 + (10% / 1) ^ (1 x 1) = $11,000 The formula can also be rearranged to find the value of the future sum in present day dollars. For example, the value of $5,000 one year from today, compounded
            at 7% interest, is: PV = $5,000 / (1 + (7% / 1) ^ (1 x 1) = $4,673 Effect of Compounding Periods on Future Value The number of compounding periods can have a drastic effect on the TVM calculations. Taking the $10,000 example above, if the number of compounding periods is increased to quarterly,
            monthly or daily, the ending future value calculations are: Quarterly Compounding: FV = $10,000 x (1 + (10% / 4) ^ (4 x 1) = $11,038 Monthly Compounding: FV = $10,000 x (1 + (10% / 12) ^ (12 x 1) = $11,047 Daily Compounding: FV = $10,000 x (1 + (10% / 365) ^ (365 x 1) = $11,052 This shows
            TVM depends not only on interest rate and time horizon, but also on how many times the compounding calculations are computed each year. Read more: Time Value of Money (TVM) https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp#ixzz5O5ki8VT7 Follow us: Investopedia on Facebook

        <h1>GMO Food</h1>
        <figure>
            <img src="./img/gmo.jpg" alt="GMO">
            <figcaption>A variety of foods are genetically modified.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>t’s a growing controversy: Should GMO foods always be labeled so consumers are aware that the product contains genetically modified ingredients? GMOs—or genetically modified organisms—are created in a lab by altering the genetic makeup of a plant or an animal. Ninety-two percent of Americans
            believe that GMO foods—widely found in kitchens across the country—should be labeled before they’re sold, according to a recent nationally representative survey of 1,004 people from the Consumer Reports National Research Center. (Last year our tests discovered that GMOs were present in many
            packaged foods, such as breakfast cereals, chips, baking mixes, and protein bars.) Demand for non-GMO foods has skyrocketed: In 2013, sales of non-GMO products that were either certified organic (by law, organic products can’t be made with GMO ingredients) or that carried the “Non-GMO Project
            Verified” seal increased by 80 percent, according to the Nutrition Business Journal. It has prompted a growing number of companies to avoid using GMOs in new products or to voluntarily reformulate existing ones so that they can sport reliable non-GMO labels. PepsiCo, for example, sells Stacy’s
            Simply Naked bagel and pita chips with the Non-GMO Project Verified seal; General Mills, which introduced a non-GMO original Cheerios cereal early last year, also has the non-GMO product lines Cascadian Farm and Food Should Taste Good. Yet GMO labeling has become a hot-button issue: Vermont
            passed a GMO labeling law last April. Last fall, the question of whether food manufacturers should be required to list GMO ingredients on their product labels was put to voters in Colorado and Oregon. On both sides were strong arguments and a lot of money spent—mostly on the part of food
            and chemical industry opponents to labeling. (In the Colorado election, for example, they outspent labeling supporters by about 16 to 1.) The measure was rejected in Colorado, and it failed in Oregon by a razor-thin margin in a recount—837 votes. In an interesting twist, some food companies
            that expressed strong opposition to such mandatory labeling are the same ones turning out new non-GMO products. “They are experimenting, in case labeling does become mandatory and boosts demand for non-GMOs,” says Nathan Hendricks, Ph.D., an agricultural economist at Kansas State University.
            “Of course, they may do this without too much fanfare to avoid raising questions about why they’re removing GMOs from some of their products but not others.” With so many voices in the conversation and products on the market, how can you make buying decisions that are best for you and your
            family? Our Q&A helps you separate fact from fiction. Are GMOs bad for my health? Those who support using GMOs point out that Americans have been eating foods containing them for more than 15 years and that there’s no credible evidence that people have been harmed. But saying there’s no evidence
            of harm isn’t the same as saying they’ve been proved safe. “The contention that GMOs pose no risks to human health can’t be supported by studies that have measured a time frame that is too short to determine the effects of exposure over a lifetime,” says Robert Gould, M.D., president of the
            board of Physicians for Social Responsibility. A joint commission of the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has established a protocol for evaluating the safety of GMOs, which it says have the potential to introduce toxins and new allergens
            (or increase levels of existing ones), or cause nutritional changes in foods and other unexpected effects.

        <h1>THE WORLD IN 2100</h1>

        <p>
 As it drifts into the 22nd century, the world is a dynamic and somewhat turbulent place. It is possible to argue that things have gotten better and that they have gotten worse. On one hand, as per 2017 expectations, technology is far more advanced. Most diseases have been cured, space colonies dot the
moon and global living standards are higher than they have ever been. On the other, the planet is still recovering from the effects of global warming and the economic and political crises that followed. The world is still in a bit of an economic slump. Then there is the ever growing fear that something,
anything, could go wrong in mankind’s increasingly complex and expensive methods of obtaining enough food and water for the earth’s growing population of 10.5 billion. <br>
The world ran out of fossil fuels around 2080 but enough clean energy was already being used to prevent a total social collapse in, most,
regions. Today green energy is king, be it nuclear, solar or wind. Vast scapes of ten story tall windmills can be found off the coast of every continent, in rural areas and even in the middle of the ocean. Seemingly endless arrays of solar panels dot otherwise useless and desolate parts of the world
like the Sahara, the Arabian desert and the Mexican wastelands. The solar industry is the second largest in the world, besides farming, and produces power for an estimated 6 billion people, the majority of humanity. Nuclear power has had its ups and downs, but after a few nuclear disasters that left
many thousands of people dead the nuclear industry has been on a long and painful decline. Then there is antimatter. Scientists and engineers have been very sceptical about using it as the amount of antimatter already produced in labs has the potential energy to annihilate the planet if set off, but
controlled reactions have produced mind numbing amounts of energy. Proper antimatter plants have been slow to pop up but they are currently increasing in size at a now exponential rate. Japan in particular was quick to take advantage of this new technology.<br>
Then there is space, truly the final frontier for mankind. Although space tech advanced leaps and bounds in the later half of the 20th century, the 21st century has been an era of both exploration and colonisation. There are hundreds of thousands of satellites orbiting the earth, most of them smaller and used only for communication but others capable of housing large amounts of people for long periods of time. Zeus-1, the world’s largest satellite currently orbiting the earth, can be summed up as a flying city, complete with barber shops, over a dozen restaurants and even an on board zoo. The moon holds a population of roughly 70 thousand and growing. It is divided between 67 nations so far with a lot of disputed or unclaimed territory in between. There are also a lot of nations that still hold onto their claims even though they haven’t even tried to get people onto the lunar surface. A bunch of mining companies have turned to the moon and the asteroid belt to get rich after most governments on earth begin to turn their backs on anything that could damage the environment. Mars also has a few permanent residents though they are mostly scientists and the whole planet is still considered international territory. Beyond that progress is slow. There are talks of setting up colonies on Titan but nobody wants to volunteer to go that far away from the sun yet. Humans have temporarily landed on a few of jupiter's moons and some of the larger asteroids. At least two dozen planets are known to have alien life on them but the nearest one is almost 70 light years away and no sign of intellegent life can be found, yet.
